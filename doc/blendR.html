<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This package provides several estimators of total for combining a non-probability sample with a probability sample. In general, probability samples are preferred to non-probability samples because the sampling variance of the estimators calculated from probability samples can be determined using standard sampling theory. Even non-sampling errors, such as non-response bias, may be easier to assess and mitigate for probability samples. The primary disadvantage of non-probability samples is the potential for biased estimation stemming from undercoverage and a lack of representativeness in the samples. Without external sources of information, these sample deficiencies cannot be detected.</p>
<p>In reality, it is usually easier to obtain a non-probability sample than a probability sample. For example, a frame may not be available, which complicates the selection of a probability sample. A non-probability sample, such as one using data from volunteers, does not require an expensive nonresponse follow-up. The larger the sample, the more information it may contain. This is an attractive option for analysts working with limited resources while studying elusive populations. As a result, statisticians have begun to investigate methods for improving estimation using data from non-probability samples. One such method is augment a non-probability sample with a probability sample to lend strength to the probability sample in the for of additional data.</p>
<p>There are many ways of combining data sources. In this package the combination of a non-probability sample with a probability sample occurs under the assumptions of a capture-recapture model.</p>
</div>
<div id="capture-recapture-methodology" class="section level2">
<h2>Capture-Recapture Methodology</h2>
<p>Capture-recapture methods are powerful ways to estimate total in specific scenarios. In a classic example, suppose a researcher wishes to know the total number of fish (<span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>) in the local fishing hole. On the initial fishing trip, she catches <span class="math inline">\(n_1\)</span> fish. These fish are tagged so they can be identified later. The next day she returns to the same fishing hole and catches <span class="math inline">\(n_2\)</span> fish. In this second catch, suppose <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> fish were also caught on the first day, identifiable by their tag. If the proportion of tagged fish in the second sample is approximately equal to the proportion of tagged fish in the population of fish, then <span class="math inline">\(E(\frac{n_1}{N}) \approx \frac{m}{n_2}\)</span>. This leads to the Lincoln-Peterson estimator of total <span class="citation">Le Cren (1965)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\hat{N} = \frac{n_1 n_2}{m}.\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\hat{N}\)</span> is the maximum likelihood estimator of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> under the hypergeometric model, which assumes the recapture sample is a simple random sample (SRS). This SRS assumption does not necessarily extend to the initial sample.</p>
</div>
<div id="sampling-set-up" class="section level2">
<h2>Sampling Set-up</h2>
<p>The estimators from this package assume the non-probability sample is analogous to the initial capture sample, while the probability sample acts as the recapture sample. For the estimators used in this package, the data must be gathered such that units in the non-probability sample may be gathered into the probability sample with some positive, known probability. Each sample must record the same variable of interest, though this is not required for the first estimator below.</p>
<p>Define the universe of interest to be made up of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> units and call the population <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>. Call the probability sample <span class="math inline">\(s_2\)</span> and the non-probability sample <span class="math inline">\(d_1\)</span>, since it can be thought of as a domain. There are <span class="math inline">\(n_2\)</span> units sampled in <span class="math inline">\(s_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n_1\)</span> units captured in the non-probability sample <span class="math inline">\(d_1\)</span>. Denote by <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> the number of units present in both <span class="math inline">\(d_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s_2\)</span>. Then the number of units in <span class="math inline">\(d_1\)</span> only is <span class="math inline">\(n_1 - m\)</span>, and the number of units in <span class="math inline">\(s_2\)</span> only is <span class="math inline">\(n_2-m\)</span>. The objective is to estimate <span class="math inline">\(t_y\)</span> from the data from the two samples, when <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is unknown.</p>
<p>Define the variable of interest for each unit in the population as <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(i = 1,...,N\)</span>). Thus the goal is to estimate <span class="math inline">\(t_y = \sum_{i=1}^{N}y_i\)</span>. In the non-probility sample, the variable of interest for the <span class="math inline">\(i^{th}\)</span> unit is denoted <span class="math inline">\(y^*_i\)</span>.</p>
<p>If the <span class="math inline">\(i^{th}\)</span> unit is not a part of the non-probability sample, <span class="math inline">\(y^*_i\)</span> is defined to be 0. <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span> is distinguished from <span class="math inline">\(y^*_i\)</span> as measurement error or other non-sampling errors.</p>
<p>The estimators included in this package are especially useful when the non-probability sample has access to more members of the population than the probability sample does. That is, if the non-probability sample can include units which otherwise are not able to be sampled, these estimators are extremely useful. An example of this may be a voluntary (non-probability/capture) sample on a street corner and a random sample (probability/recapture) of households in the area. It may be that some respondents to the voluntary sample do not live in houses in the area, perhaps they are homeless. The recapture sample cannot sample these people, but they may be a part of the universe of interest.</p>
<p>The first three estimators are taken from <span class="citation">Liu et al. (2017)</span> and the last one from <span class="citation">Breidt et al. (2018)</span>. The estimators are now described.</p>
</div>
<div id="estimator-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Estimator 1</h2>
<p>The first estimator is denoted <span class="math inline">\(\hat{t}_{yp}\)</span> and is a generalized version of an estimator developed by <span class="citation">Pollock et al. (1994)</span>. Their data consists of a probability sample of fishing docks where interviewers record fish catch by incoming boats and a voluntary sample of trip counts (but not catch) self-reported by fishing captains. In this method the capture and the recapture samples are used to estimate the total number of trips <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, which is then multiplied by an estimate of mean catch, determined from the recapture sample only : <span class="math display">\[\hat{t}_{yp} = \hat{N}\hat{\bar{y}}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\hat{N}\)</span> is defined above for a capture-recapture setting and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\bar{y}}\)</span> is the average catch from the probability intercept sample <span class="citation">Pollock et al. (1994)</span>. The expected value of this estimator is equal to <span class="math inline">\(t_y\)</span> when the intercept sample is a SRS of <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>.</p>
<p>Liu et al generalizes this estimator for a complex sample design with sampling weights: <span class="math display">\[ \hat{t}_{yp}=\frac{n_1}{\hat{p}_1}\hat{\bar{y}}=n_1\frac{\hat{t}_y}{\hat{n}_1} \]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(r_i\)</span> is an indicator of whether a unit is a member of the non-probability sample <span class="math display">\[r_i = 
\begin{cases}
    1 &amp; \text{if $i$ $\in$ $d_1$}\\
    0 &amp; \text{otherwise}\\
\end{cases}
\]</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{n}_1=\sum_{i \in s_2}w_ir_i\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}_1=\frac{\sum_{i \in s_2}^{}w_ir_i}{\sum_{i \in s_2}w_i}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\hat{t}_y}{\hat{n}_1}=\frac{\sum_{i \in s_2}^{}w_iy_i}{\sum_{i \in s_2}w_ir_i}\)</span> are Horvitz-Thompson estimators of <span class="math inline">\(n_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p_1=\frac{n_1}{N}\)</span> (the rate that non-probability units are selected into the probability sample), and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{t_y}{n_1}\)</span>, respectively. The <span class="math inline">\(w_i's\)</span> are sampling weights, computed as reciprocals of the selection probabilities. Then, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{t}_{yp}\)</span> is a ratio estimator with ratio <span class="math inline">\(B_p=\frac{t_y}{n_1}\)</span> and with <span class="math inline">\(r_i\)</span> as the auxiliary variable.</p>
<p>To use <span class="math inline">\(\hat{t}_{yp}\)</span>, one only needs to know the values of the variable of interest (<span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span>) from the probability sample, and whether or not that unit was also in the capture (non-probability) sample (<span class="math inline">\(r_i\)</span>).</p>
<p>In this package, <code>t_p()</code> is the function to use <span class="math inline">\(\hat{t}_{yp}\)</span>. This function requires a dataset parameter denoted <code>data</code>. <code>data</code> should be a data frame where each row is an observation from the recapture sample, containing information gathered from the recapture sample, whether or not the unit is also in the capture sample, along with sample design information. The parameter <code>recapture_total</code> is the value of the variable for each unit in the recapture (probability) sample. <code>captured</code> is an indicator variable of whether the sample unit (sampled in recapture sample) is also in the capture sample. <code>survey_design</code> is a specified (possibly complex) survey design specified with <code>survey::svydesign()</code> <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survey/survey.pdf">survey package</a>. <code>na_remove</code> is set to <code>TRUE</code> as a default, and <code>capture_units</code> is a numeric value of the total number of units in the capture sample.</p>
</div>
<div id="estimator-2" class="section level2">
<h2>Estimator 2</h2>
<p>The next estimator uses the value of the variable of interest collected in the non-probability sample (denoted <span class="math inline">\(y^*_i\)</span>) as an auxiliary variable: <span class="math display">\[\hat{t}_{yc}=t_{y^*}\frac{\hat{t}_y}{\hat{t}_{y^*}}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(t_{y^*}=\sum_{i=1}^{n_1}r_i{y_i}^*\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{t}_y=\sum_{i \in s_2}w_iy_i\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{t}_{y^*}=\sum_{i \in s_2}w_ir_i{y_i}^*\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(t_{y^*}\)</span> is the total of the variable of interest for the entire non-probability sample, and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{t}_{y^*}\)</span> is its estimator. <span class="math inline">\(\hat{t}_{yc}\)</span> is also a ratio estimator with auxiliary variable <span class="math inline">\(r_iy^*_i\)</span> and ratio <span class="math inline">\(B_c = \frac{t_y}{t_{y^*}}\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\hat{t}_{yc}\)</span> takes the form of a capture-recapture estimator and uses the values from the non-probability sample as auxiliary information.</p>
<p>In this package, <code>t_c()</code> is the function to use <span class="math inline">\(\hat{t}_{yc}\)</span>. This function requires a dataset called <code>data</code>, which is a dataframe, where each row is an observation from the recapture sample. If the row refers to a unit which is also in the capture sample, the data frame contains the information gathered from the recapture sample. If the row refers to a unit in the recapture sample only, those columns for recapture sample data should contain zeros. The data frame also should contain sample design information. The parameter <code>recapture_total</code> is the value of the variable for each unit in the recapture (probability) sample. <code>captured_total</code> is the value of the variable for each unit in the capture (non-probability) sample. <code>survey_design</code> is a specified surey design, as described above. <code>na_remove</code> is set to <code>TRUE</code> as a default, and <code>total_from_capture</code> is a numeric value of the sum of all the values of the variable of interest from the capture sample (<span class="math inline">\(t_{y^*}\)</span>).</p>
</div>
<div id="estimator-3" class="section level2">
<h2>Estimator 3</h2>
<p>The third estimator is a special case of a weighted combination of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{t}_{yp}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{t}_{yc}\)</span> called <span class="math inline">\(t_{MR}\)</span>. <span class="math display">\[\hat{t}_{MR}=(1-W_{SRS})\hat{t}_{yp}+W_{SRS}\hat{t}_{yc}\]</span> <span class="math inline">\(\hat{t}_{MR}\)</span> is a multivariate ratio estimator (Olkin, 1958). The optimal weight <span class="math inline">\(W_{SRS}\)</span> if the recapture sample were a SRS would be: <span class="math display">\[W_{SRS}=\frac{t_{y^*}}{t_y}\frac{S_{1,yy^*}}{S_{1y^*}^2}=\frac{t_{y^*}}{t_y}\frac{S_{1y}}{S_{1y^*}}R_{1,yy^*}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(S_{1,yy^*}\)</span> is the covariance of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y^*\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(d_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(S^2_{1y^*}\)</span> is the variance of <span class="math inline">\(y^*\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(d_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(S_{1y}\)</span> is the standard deviation of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(d_1\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(R_{1,yy^*}\)</span> is the correlation of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y^*\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(d_1\)</span>.</p>
<p>In applications, <span class="math inline">\(W_{SRS}\)</span> will be unknown, but it can be consistently estimated by <span class="math display">\[\hat{W}_{SRS} = \frac{t_{y*}}{\hat{t}_{yc}}.\]</span></p>
<p>When <span class="math inline">\(\hat{W}_{SRS}\)</span> is substituted for <span class="math inline">\(W_{SRS}\)</span>, the resulting estimator simplifies to: <span class="math display">\[ \hat{t}_{y2} = t_{y*} + \frac{n_1}{\hat{n}_1}(\hat{t}_y - \hat{t}_{y*}).\]</span></p>
<p>This estimator is proposed even for complex sample designs. <span class="math inline">\(\hat{t}_{y2}\)</span> adjusts the total of the variable of interest from the capture sample additively rather than multiplicatively, as <span class="math inline">\(\hat{t}_{yc}\)</span> does.</p>
<p>In this package, <code>t_y2()</code> is the function to use <span class="math inline">\(\hat{t}_{y2}\)</span>. This function requires a dataset called <code>data</code>, which is a dataframe where each row is an observation from the recapture sample. If the row refers to a unit which is also in the capture sample, the data frame contains the information gathered from the recapture sample. If the row refers to a unit only in the recapture sample, those columns for recapture sample data contain zeros. The data frame should contain a variable <code>delta</code>, see below, and and sample design information. The parameter <code>delta</code> is a variable from <code>data</code>. For every unit in the recapture sample, <code>delta</code> is the value of the variable of interest observed in the recapture sample minus the value observed in the capture sample. If the unit in the recapture sample is not also a member of the capture sample, <code>delta</code><span class="math inline">\(= 0\)</span>. <code>captured</code> is an indicator variable of a unit being in the capture sample. <code>survey_design</code> is a survey design, described above, <code>na_remove</code> is set to <code>TRUE</code> as a default, <code>capture_units</code> is a numeric value of the total number of units in the capture sample, and <code>total_from_capture</code> is a numeric value of the sum of all the values of the variable of interest from the capture sample (<span class="math inline">\(t_{y^*}\)</span>).</p>

<h2>Estimator 4</h2>
<p>The final estimator is a difference estimator, denoted <span class="math inline">\(t_{diff}\)</span>, proposed by <span class="citation">Breidt et al. (2018)</span>. The estimator assumes the sampling frame is complete. That is, for unbiased and valid estimation, every unit must have a known positive probability of being selected into the sample.</p>
<p>The difference estimator is expressed as: <span class="math display">\[ t_{diff} = t^*_y + (\hat{t}_y + \hat{t}^*_y) \]</span>. In this package, <code>t_diff()</code> is the function to use <span class="math inline">\(t_{diff}\)</span>. This function requires a dataset called <code>data</code>, which is a dataframe where each row is an observation from the recapture sample. If the row refers to a unit which is also in the capture sample, the data frame contains the information gathered from the recapture sample. If the row refers to a unit only in the recapture sample, those columns for recapture sample data contain zeros. The data frame should contain a variable <code>delta</code>, see below, and and sample design information. The parameter <code>delta</code> is a variable from <code>data</code>. For every unit in the recapture sample, <code>delta</code> is the value of the variable of interest observed in the recapture sample minus the value observed in the capture sample. If the unit in the recapture sample is not also a member of the capture sample, <code>delta</code><span class="math inline">\(= 0\)</span>. <code>survey_design</code> is a survey design, described above, <code>na_remove</code> is set to <code>TRUE</code> as a default, and <code>total_from_capture</code> is a numeric value of the sum of all the values of the variable of interest from the capture sample (<span class="math inline">\(t_{y^*}\)</span>).</p>
<p>Each estimator described above may suffer from undercoverage if the sampling frame is incomplete. In general, <span class="math display">\[ t_{y2} \]</span> performs best out of the ratio estimators, in terms of standard error. However, depending on the available data, not all estimators may be appropriate. Dissertation research by the author (Benjamin Williams) is comparing all the estimators under more situations. A working paper by Stokes, Williams, McShane, and Zalsha, is looking at the effects of non-sampling errors on these estimators. The reference will be updated when the article is published.</p>
<p>Each of the four estimators returns the values <code>total</code> and <code>se</code>, which are the estimates of total of the variable of interest and its standard error, respectively.</p>
