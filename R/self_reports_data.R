## Self-Reports

#' @title Captains' Self-Reports from 2016 Texas Parks and Wildlife Red Snapper Capture-Recapture Sampling Program
#'
#'@description This dataset comes from a voluntary sample of charter fishing captains. The
#'captains could self-report (via a smartphone app) their catch of Red Snapper fish and the number of anglers for each
#'fishing trip. Each reported trip could also be sampled into a probability sample of docks along the
#'Texas coast. Interviewers for the dockside sample boarded the boats and observed the number of Red Snapper
#'caught and the number of anglers onboard. The self-reports are the "capture" sample and the dockside intercept
#'is the "recapture" sample.
